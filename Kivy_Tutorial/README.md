# Kivy Tutorial

Contains source code for a basic kivy application that features:
- A login page where a user can enter username and password credentials
- User credential validation
- An interactive screen where users can select an option from a list of text boxes that can later be seen on another page in the format of 'You answered: yourChoiceHere'

Although this application is an adpatation of the tutorial I completed that includes several features that were not covered, my work is inspired by the concepts taught in Tech With Tim's Python Kivy Course https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kSJVMyYeOQ8CXJ3z1k7gHn
